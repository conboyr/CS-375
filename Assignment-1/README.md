# Assignment 1

I Found this website [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/examples/) and I was really intrigued with all the examples listed and how interactive they were.
Not only are there a bunch of really cool examples but there is documentation for the "scenes" that you can create yourself. There's also a discord server
listed so you can connect with other people and see projects others are working on. It seems like this is all built in Javascript hence the name of the website.
I noticed that the examples on the website actually ran much better on certain browsers. I have been trying out Opera GX which is supposed to cater to 
video streaming services better than othher browsers but the animations were really "laggy" on it. Tried them out on firefox/chrome and they worked really well.
There's also an editor where you can edit your own 3D projects right in the browser. I definitely reccomend this!
